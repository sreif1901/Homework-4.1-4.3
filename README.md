# Homework-4.1-4.3

Homework 4.1: Add some more data in the dictionary
For now our game only stores the number of attempts and the date. Let's also store the name of the player and the secret number in each game.

Homework 4.2: Add unsuccessful guesses into the dictionary
During the game, collect user's unsuccessful guesses and then store them in the dictionary under the name "wrong_guesses".

Bonus homework 4.3: Print out only the top 3 results
Now that we removed the score_list.sort() line (because it doesn't work with dictionaries in the list), we have to find another way to sort the scores.
There are many ways how to do it. Use your imagination (and Google) and try to figure out at least one of them. :)
